# **Naive-Bayes-Classifiers** 🍻  
### *A machine learning approach to predict beer quality using Naive Bayes Classifiers*

---

## 📌 **Overview**
Welcome to the **Naive-Bayes-Classifiers** project! 🍺 This project focuses on predicting beer quality based on several important features using the Naive Bayes Classifier. The model is trained using a real-world beer dataset and classifies beer quality into different categories, helping in quality assessments for breweries and beer enthusiasts alike!

---

## 🔥 **Features**
- 🔍 **Predict Beer Quality**: Classify beers into quality categories based on various attributes.  
- 🧠 **Naive Bayes Algorithm**: Implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.  
- 📊 **Real-World Dataset**: Uses `realdataset.csv` to train the model, featuring actual beer quality data.  
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and more to evaluate the model's performance.  
- ⚙️ **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Ready-to-run Python scripts and a Jupyter Notebook for flexibility.

---

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - 📦 `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis.  
  - 📦 `numpy` - Scientific computing.  
  - 📦 `scikit-learn` - Machine learning and model evaluation.  
- **Dataset**: `realdataset.csv`  
- **Algorithm**: Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian Naive Bayes)

## 🚀 **Getting Started**
To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

---

### **1. Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python (Version 3.x)
- Required Python Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn

You can install the libraries with the following command:
``bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

2. Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Suraj7897/Naive-Bayes-Classifiers.git
cd Naive-Bayes-Classifiers
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Running the Model
Once everything is set up, run the predict_beer_quality.py script to train and test the Naive Bayes model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict_beer_quality.py
Alternatively, you can experiment with the Jupyter Notebook for interactive development:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook trial.ipynb

4. Dataset
The realdataset.csv contains features like beer attributes (e.g., alcohol content, bitterness, etc.) used for predicting the quality.
The dataset is crucial for training the Naive Bayes model, and it should be placed in the same folder as the Python script or Notebook.

5. Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. Upon running the script, you’ll see the performance metrics and predictions in the terminal or notebook output.
